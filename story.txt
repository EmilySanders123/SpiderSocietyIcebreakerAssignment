There once was a jester put up in an Schloss.
A fellow jester walked by the first jester and kicked him in the lederhose. 
He went to the baeckerei and got some brot to eat.
For dessert, he had some apfelkuchen.
Then he unsteadily walked into his porsche, gleefully laughing as he eratically drove away.
The jester went on a hike throughout Berlin.
The jester made sure to don their Lederhose beforehand.
Tired of walking, wearing naught but his Lederhose, the jester attempts to hitchhike, becoming wettbewerbsfaehig with other jesters on the side of the road.
Professor Mehlhase pulled up in her BMW and jumped in to stop the fight!
"Why are you being such loons?" she asked emphatically. "Have some gebaeck."
She made them all wear dirndels as punishment, and they all lived happily ever after and never fought again.
However, a Porsche hit the jester and left him unable to walk. 
The jester was left lying on the ground on the Hasuptstrasse.
Luckily, his lederhosen had magical healing powers.
The jester walked away until a hund jumped from a bush towards their direction. 
He was chased all the way to Raesfeld, where he lost his pursuers by fleeing into the walls of Schloss Eltz.
